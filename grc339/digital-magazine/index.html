                                <h3>Concerts Returning Post Covid-19</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When cities and states around the country began issuing stay-at-home orders in March of last year, Live For Live Music turned to tracking cancellations rather than promoting shows. But as vaccination rates rise and governments relax their pandemic regulations, the music marketing and production company’s site is getting back to normal. <br>

                                    “For the first time in longer than we can remember, today’s update doesn’t feature a single cancellation or postponement,” reads a recent Live For Live Music blog post.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The recovery of the event ecosystem is happening faster than expected. Events professionals see the number of events and event attendance reaching and potentially surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2019. But that recovery is contingent on a number of factors, including how effective the vaccine program is, the nature of the events themselves, and where they are located.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Event industry leaders pointed again and again to pent-up demand to illustrate their certainty that events would succeed in a post-pandemic world. After a year and a half spent at home, many people are more than ready to attend festivals, concerts, sporting events, and other big group pastimes they’ve been missing. So far it looks like they’re doing their best to make up for lost time.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What current events data suggests
                                    June is on track to be the first month since before the pandemic began that events in the United States will bring in more than a billion dollars, according to new data from demand forecast company PredictHQ. The total economic impact — an estimate of spending on travel, food, and lodging for the largest 2,500 events this month, including sports, concerts, conferences, and expos — is expected to be $1.6 billion, which is more than it has been in over a year.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    These types of events were all but absent over the past year, as health measures prohibited many group activities. June’s numbers represent a substantial improvement, and will likely increase as cities and states continue to roll back their restrictions around capacity and masking, and more events get added to calendars.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    “There’s capital available, there is this pent-up demand, and there are these events being generated for people,” PredictHQ CEO and co-founder Campbell Brown told Recode, describing what he called the “perfect storm of demand.”
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The country’s top ticket sellers are welcoming the change, as well.

                                    “Demand is roaring back in a way that’s exceeding our expectations as recently as 60 days ago,” Akshay Khanna, general manager of ticket exchange StubHub, told Recode. “It’s driven by confidence in the vaccine program and the sheer numbers of vaccinations since February.”

                                    Lorde will release her long-awaited third album, Solar Power, on August 20th via Republic Records. The album announcement arrives a couple of weeks after Lorde released the album’s title track, which marked her first new music since the arrival of her last record, 2017’s Melodrama. Lorde co-wrote and produced “Solar Power” with frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff, while Clairo and Phoebe Bridgers provided backing vocals on the song.

                                    On Planet Her, Doja Cat invites us into the exquisitely strange and spectacularly camp world she’s been teasing and toying with over her last few releases. There’s a bit of cheeky, sci-fi B movie references in the presentation but the content itself is pristine pop fun. Frequent collaborator Yeti Beats along with rising star Y2K keep the show moving, matching the rapper-singer’s chaotic energy with a mix of trap, funk and bubblegum.

                                    For 10 years, Olamide Faison was a regular on the Bitter End’s stage. He played most weeks at the small, unassuming venue on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, cultivating his sound in the same spot where many rock ’n’ roll legends – from Jimi Hendrix to Bob Dylan – also played.

                                    Faison has been a musician for most of his life, playing in different venues across the country, including as part of ‘90s boy band Imajin. But his time at the Bitter End is special.

                                        Just a year and a half after releasing her most recent album, Manic, Halsey has announced the next era of her discography. Halsey confirmed on June 28 that If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power is its official title. A ten-second teaser signifies that Halsey’s sonic direction will be punk rock as opposed to her previous pop earworms.

Here’s a look at where drive-in concerts are taking places across the country and how you can watch them.
