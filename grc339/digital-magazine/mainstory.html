                                <p>                                    When cities and states around the country began issuing stay-at-home orders in March of last year, Live For Live Music turned to tracking cancellations rather than promoting shows. But as vaccination rates rise and governments relax their pandemic regulations, the music marketing and production company’s site is getting back to normal. </p>

                                   <p> “For the first time in longer than we can remember, today’s update doesn’t feature a single cancellation or postponement,” reads a recent Live For Live Music blog post.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>The recovery of the event ecosystem is happening faster than expected. Events professionals see the number of events and event attendance reaching and potentially surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2019. But that recovery is contingent on a number of factors, including how effective the vaccine program is, the nature of the events themselves, and where they are located.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>Event industry leaders pointed again and again to pent-up demand to illustrate their certainty that events would succeed in a post-pandemic world. After a year and a half spent at home, many people are more than ready to attend festivals, concerts, sporting events, and other big group pastimes they’ve been missing. So far it looks like they’re doing their best to make up for lost time.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                   <p> What current events data suggests
                                    June is on track to be the first month since before the pandemic began that events in the United States will bring in more than a billion dollars, according to new data from demand forecast company PredictHQ. The total economic impact — an estimate of spending on travel, food, and lodging for the largest 2,500 events this month, including sports, concerts, conferences, and expos — is expected to be $1.6 billion, which is more than it has been in over a year.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>These types of events were all but absent over the past year, as health measures prohibited many group activities. June’s numbers represent a substantial improvement, and will likely increase as cities and states continue to roll back their restrictions around capacity and masking, and more events get added to calendars.
                                  
                                   </p>

                                <p> “There’s capital available, there is this pent-up demand, and there are these events being generated for people,” PredictHQ CEO and co-founder Campbell Brown told Recode, describing what he called the “perfect storm of demand.”
                                    
                                    
                                    The country’s top ticket sellers are welcoming the change, as well.

                                    “Demand is roaring back in a way that’s exceeding our expectations as recently as 60 days ago,” Akshay Khanna, general manager of ticket exchange StubHub, told Recode. “It’s driven by confidence in the vaccine program and the sheer numbers of vaccinations since February.”</p>

                                <p>StubHub is expecting the number of events and ticket sales in the second half of the year to match and potentially exceed 2019, given this rush of demand and the increase in the number of events being announced.

“Understanding pent-up demand and human nature, I would be surprised if it wasn’t the case, assuming the vaccine rollout continues and caseload numbers continue to decrease,” Khanna said.

                                <p>Live Nation, the event company that owns Ticketmaster, recently reported that major tour dates booked for next year are up double digits compared to 2019, which was a record year for the company. But so far this year, events haven’t yet reached their pre-pandemic levels, either in number of events or overall attendance, according to PredictHQ.

As of late May, attendance at festivals scheduled for the second half of the year is expected to reach 87 percent of its 2019 levels, according to PredictHQ. Meanwhile, concerts and conferences are at just 53 percent of their 2019 attendance for events that were listed as of May each year. Sporting events were slightly higher at 58 percent and rising.</p>
